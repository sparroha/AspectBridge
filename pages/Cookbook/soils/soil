Law of the Minimum = if any nutrient is < nutrual0
//any essential nutrient can become the controlling force in crop yield. 

//Of all the essential nutrients, nitrogen is required by plants in the largest quantity and 
//is most frequently the limiting factor in crop productivity.

//In plant tissue, the nitrogen content ranges from 1 and 6%.
//Proper management of nitrogen is important because it is often the most limiting nutrient in crop production 
//and easily lost from the soil system.
//Nitrogen Forms and Function
//Forms of nitrogen available for plant uptake
//Ammonium
//Nitrate
//Functions of nitrogen in plants
//Nitrogen is an essential element of all amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
//Nitrogen is also a component of nucleic acids, which form the DNA of all living things and holds the genetic code.
//Nitrogen is a component of chlorophyll, which is the site of carbohydrate formation (photosynthesis).
//Chlorophyll is also the substance that gives plants their green color.
//Photosynthesis occurs at high rates when there is sufficient nitrogen.
//A plant receiving sufficient nitrogen will typically exhibit vigorous plant growth. 
// Leaves will also develop a dark green color.
